# Learning the C++ Standard Template Library
## About this repository
Using the STL in C++ makes implementing more logically intensive solutions for competitive programming problems a breeze. This repository was created to reference as documentation for my study of the standard template library in C++. Have a look at my [competitive programming repository](https://github.com/0xVolt/cp) where I put into practice everything I document learning here. 
## What is the STL?
C++ Standard Template Library (STL) is a collection of pre-defined data structures and algorithms that are commonly used in programming problems, especially those pertaining to the highly competitive domain of competitive programming (CP). These data structures and algorithms come ready to implement out-of-the-box as classes that we create instances of. No more reinventing the wheel.
